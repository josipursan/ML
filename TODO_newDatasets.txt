Dataset 1 : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/291/airfoil+self+noise
    -plenty of data
    -continuous target variable to model - scaled-sound-pressure

=================

Dataset 2 : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/193/cardiotocography
    -plenty of data
    -a simple classification problem

=================

Dataset 3 : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/183/communities+and+crime
    -plenty of data, plenty variables
    -will have to pick and choose variables
    -regerssion problem - trying to predict total number of violent crimes per 100K population
    -try choosing non-obvious variables to see how well you can use them to model predictions that are obviously inferable from well documented variables

================

For each dataset : 
    1. /repo/reports/datasetReport.md - getting to know the dataset
        -attach scatter plots, bar chart (binned, ie. a distribution plot), and violin plots for all variables
        -3-5 sentences for each variable explaining what kind of transformation and scaling will be done, why it will be used
        -at the very top of this report attach a table showing min, max, mean, median, skew, variance, std.dev., and kurtosis for each variable
        -don't forget to evaluate target variable also

    2. Split raw dataset into train, validation and test sets
        -either save this locally, or do it each time before training

    3. Based on findings from datasetReport.md, apply necessary scaling and transformations
    
    4. Start with a very basic NN model - no initializers, no alpha schedulers, no dropout, no any kind of regularization
        -graph training, validation and test set losses after each training round

    5. Manually explore architecture and hyperparam spaces until you hit a range of values that is reliably pointing towards a possibly optimal architecture
        5.1. Using findings from bulletpoint 5 run an architecture and hyperparam grid search (scikit already has grid search) to find the best performing network

    6. /repo/reports/FinalReport.md
        -loss vs. epoch graphs for training, validation and test set for 5 different models : the best performing one, worst performing, and three wild models (e.g. a lot of layers with a lot of neurons, a lot of layers with little neurons, small number of layers with little neurons, etc.)
        -scatter plot comparing predictions (y_hat) to ground truth label (y)
        -performance metrics : 
            -MAE, MSE, R^2 for regression problems
            -precision, recall, confussion matrix, F1 score, ROC and AUC for classification problems
            https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc
        -add your remarks and potential further improvements
            -what different algorithms can be used to try and solve this problem?
            -what can be improved about your methods?
            -what did you miss?
