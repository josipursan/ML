# 1 - Google movenet multiperson HPE  
This is a first dive into HPE, and as such, is intended to get acquainted with some basic actions.  
The goal **ISN'T** to become an HPE expert through one project.  
The goal is to iteratively improve, learn, and apply acquired knowledge to reach the desired solutions.

My code, and the general environment, will differ from what is shown in the video.  
Why?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I do not want to set up the same environment.
