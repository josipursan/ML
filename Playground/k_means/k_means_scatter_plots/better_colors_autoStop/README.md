This dir contains some random k-means run, but with the automatic stop implemented,  
as well as automatic color handling for the plots.  
Automatic stop is just a check if any different assignments were done compared to the previous  
iteration.  
No different datapoint assignments to centroids means optimal grouping was already achieved,  
makin further iterations pointless.
